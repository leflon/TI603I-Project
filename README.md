To run, don't forget to : 
    . `bun install` in both the client directory and the database directory
    . have started the backend and the frontend by running `bun run dev` in both directories
    . modify the `.env.example` files (removing the .example at the end)

Once this is done, go to http://localhost:5173 and everything should be fine

In case of bugs : 
    . Drop the database and recreate it
